# BankProjWebApp

Bankapp with log in and different user roles. Database initializes on first start up.

Depending on user role customers and accounts can be created and deleted. Account transfers, list sorting and unit tests are included.
Never got to adding logic for the MoneyLaunderingChecker class.
